### NOTE this is a work in progress, functionality is good but visually there is some work to be done ###

This is a little side-project that I made that makes my work easier
If you are a GoHighLevel user or you deliver support to people that do and you want to make some CSS changes you might know that you cannot view your changes live.
With this tool you can use a visual editor to change styles in the platform itself as well as the login page and the loading screen.

If you want to play with the code, clone this repo.
If you want to use the online version go to https://cobeas.nl/highlevel-css-generator-page

Please provide me any feedback you have.
Have fun and create something beautiful!
